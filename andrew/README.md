### Assets! 
I added the following .json assets files.
- advancements 
- calamities
- civs
- rules

Please check for errata and spelling/grammar errors at some point! I have gone through all of them, several times and I still missed the naval warfare credits before our last game.   

I/we will need to add info to some of these; I am thinking the civs will need to have information about what areas are "theirs" on the board and what area they start in. 

We do not need to use the rules.json in our final project but I included it as an example of using a file to hold large amounts of text. It is trivial to have React render text from a file like this and it can be convenient to edit. Something to keep in mind.
