/**
 * All classes import Test as the single public access to the testing framework.
 * 
 * Resources fall into two categories. Classes intending to be tested, "subject classes", use annotations to
 * declare test cases. The framework generates method stubs for each declared test case, which are
 * implemented in a "container class." 
 * 
 * 
 *	SUBJECT: A class that is the subject of one or more tests.
 * 
 * 		@Test.Subject( container )
 * 			A class identifies itself as a subject by using the Test.Subject annotation, 
 * 			which indicates the test container class using the following naming conventions:
 * 				.MemberName		Search for a member Test.Container class in the subject.
 * 				packagePrefix.	Prepend packagePrefix to the full subject class name and append "Test".
 * 				ClassName		Look in the same package as the subject for ClassName.
 * 				Otherwise		The name, which must contain a ".", is a fully qualified class name.
 * 			Each valid subject is represented by a sog.core.test.TestResult instance.
 * 			Members in a subject are represented by sog.core.test.TestMember instances.
 * 
 * 		@Test.Skip( rationale )
 * 			A subject may declare itself or any of its members as being exempt from testing by using 
 * 			this annotation. The given rationale should explain why the member is not being tested.
 * 			Certain members (such as the "public static void main" method, synthetic members, and 
 * 			Enum special methods) are automatically skipped. Non-skipped members generate testing 
 * 			obligations as specified by the sog.core.test.Policy.
 * 
 * 		@Test.Decl( description )
 * 			A subject class declares test cases using Test.Decl annotations on members. The declaration
 * 			gives a description which serves as additional documentation of behavior and properties
 * 			associated with the member. Each Test.Decl annotation is represented by an
 * 			sog.core.test.TestDecl instance.
 * 
 * 		@Test.Decls
 * 			The required container annotation allowing declaration annotations to be repeated.
 * 
 * 		public static void eval()
 * 			A subject can use this entry point to evaluate its own test cases. The results are 
 * 			automatically printed.
 * 				<code>public static void main( String[] args ) { Test.eval(); }</code>
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *	CONTAINER: A class that holds test method implementations for a specified subject class.
 * 
 * 		class Test.Container
 * 			The abstract base class for all concrete container classes. The constructor requires
 * 			the Class object for the corresponding subject. The framework checks for consistency
 * 			between the subject class given in the constructor and the subject's identification
 * 			of container in its Test.Subject annotation. The base class provides default
 * 			noop implementations of the procedures run before and after each test case. Concrete
 * 			containers override these as necessary. In addition, the base class provides convenience
 * 			methods for getting and setting values on a subject, and for producing a file
 * 			location identifier that can used for debugging.
 * 
 * 		@Test.Impl
 * 			Methods in the container with this annotation are the implementations of tests declared
 * 			in the corresponding subject class. Each subject Test.Decl should have a corresponding
 * 			container Test.Impl method, and the pair is identified with a single Test.Case. The
 * 			correspondence with the subject declaration is through the Test.Impl "method" and
 * 			"description" attributes. These values are generated by the framework and should not be 
 * 			altered. The framework also generates a method stub that should be copied into the
 * 			container. The generated method names can be changed if needed or desired. Test.Impl 
 * 			also has the three attributes "priority", "timeout", and "weight" which can be used to 
 * 			refine the behavior of the test. Each Test.Impl annotation is represented by a
 * 			sog.core.test.TestImpl instance.
 * 
 * 		interface Test.Case
 * 			The Test.Case interface specifies how test methods interact with the framework to report 
 * 			results. The signature of each Test.Impl test method includes a reference to a
 * 			Test.Case instance. Each (Test.Decl, Test.Impl) pair corresponds to a Test.Case 
 * 			that is implemented by a sog.core.test.TestCase instance. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 	WORKFLOW
 * 
 * 		In the subject class:
 * 			+ import sog.core.Test;
 * 			+ For non-tested class, annotate with @Test.Skip( reason ). Done.
 * 			+ @Test.Subject( container )
 * 			+ public static void main( String[] args ) { Test.eval(); }
 * 			+ Run main.
 * 			+ Confirm error regarding missing container.
 * 			+ Create stub container class.
 * 			+ Rerun main to confirm correct configuration with container.
 * 			+ Consult Policy or review errors for untested members that require testing.
 * 			+ For private/package members requiring tests, either provide well-documented
 * 				Test.Skip annotation together with description of how obligations are met through
 * 				alternate testing, OR, arrange for testing through an internal member container
 * 				so that the private members can be accessed via a nest-mate.
 * 			+ Use @Test.Decl( description ) annotations to describe test cases.
 * 			+ Rerun main to confirm no errors due to untested members.
 * 			+ Review SKIPS and fix any ERRORS.
 * 
 * 		In the container class:
 * 			+ import sog.core.Test;
 * 			+ public static void main( String[] args ) { Test.eval( SubjectClass.class ); }
 * 			+ Run main.
 * 			+ Copy subs into container body.
 * 			+ Rerun main to confirm no ERRORS, no STUBS, and all cases fail.
 * 			+ Implement test methods, run, and debug subject code.
 * 			+ Goal: 100% pass rate, no ERRORS, no STUBS, reasonable SKIPS.
 * 			+ Run tests for the entire package using Test.evalPackage( SubjectClass.class )
 * 
 *
