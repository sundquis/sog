	 * The Queue contract:
	 * 
	 * Queues have three states: open, closed, and terminated.
	 * 
	 * Queues are created open.
	 * 
	 * Allowed transitions: close(), terminate()
	 * 		O -> C
	 * 		O -> T
	 * 		C -> T
	 * 
	 * State detected by predicates
	 * 		isOpen()
	 * 		isClosed()
	 *		isTerminated()
	 *
	 * Queues are created empty
	 * 		isEmpty()
	 * 
	 * Queues may optionally specify a "full" property
	 * 
	 * Successful put/get operations alter empty status and, optionally, full status
	 * 
	 * Elements can be added to the queue: put( E elt )
	 * 		OPEN and not-full: accept the given element
	 * 		OPEN and full: unspecified
	 * 		CLOSED: Ignore the element, return false.
	 * 		TERMINATED: Ignore the element, return false.
	 * 
	 * Elements can be retrieved from the queue: E get()
	 * 		OPEN and non-empty: The next non-null element
	 * 		OPEN and empty: unspecified
	 * 		CLOSED: The next element or null if empty
	 * 		TERMINATED: null
	 * 		
	 * Implementations:
	 * 	1. Determine behavior for put( E elt ) when the queue is open and full
	 * 	2. Determine behavior for E get() when the queue is open and empty
	 * 	3. Determine the retrieval order policy
	 * 	4. Test the contract
	 * 
	 * The OPEN/CLOSED/TERMINATED semantics are enforced by the AbstractQueue.
